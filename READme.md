## Overview

### The challenge

The task at hand was to create a picture-perfect replica to the homepage designs of ZURI Team with the knowledge I've acquired on HTML5, CSS3, JS through the duration of the ZURI and Ingressive4Good Training.


### Links
This is the link to the main homepage which links to the other two webpages:

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

This final task was the hardest so far in the Zuri Internship Program, the following are the major highlights of what I learned while working on the task:
- How to properly set Background images using the Background Position property;
- How to use the CSS Positioning property to properly position elements on a page;
- How to utilize CSS animations for simple actions;
- How to integrate the Javascript onclick() function for HTML elements;
- How to style images to be responsive at various screen sizes.


### Continued development

This project has made me improve on my CSS skillset and it fueled me to learn how to work with CSS frameworks.
I struggled with creating a modal with Javascript so I know I surely have to focus on improving my knowledge and practice making more projects with Javascript.
